Number Guessing Game (C Language)
📘 Description
This is a simple number guessing game written in C.
The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.
After each guess, the program gives a hint:
🔼 “Higher number please” — if your guess is too low
🔽 “Lower number please” — if your guess is too high
🎉 “Congrat!!!” — when you guess correctly
Finally, it shows how many attempts you took to guess the number.

🧠 Concepts Used
Random number generation (rand(), srand(time(0)))
Conditional statements (if, else if, else)
Loops (do...while)
Basic input/output in C

🛠️ How to Run
Copy the code into a file named guess_game.c

Compile it using:
gcc guess_game.c -o guess_game

Run the program:
./guess_game
